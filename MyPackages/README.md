# My LaTeX packages for my documents

I created these packages to provide a certain usability without loading
hundreds of packages. I also wrote some macros and so one.

So keep in mind that these packages are all undocumented. If I think a package
or just one function could be useful for a bigger audience and this is not
available on CTAN then I will consider creating a single package with a
corresponding documentation. These packages can be found in a different
repository:
